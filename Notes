Notes

Trees:
In-Order Traversal
	- print left branch, current node, then right branch
	- for BST, this visits nodes in ascending order
Pre-Order Traversal
	- visits current node before child nodes
	- root always first value visited
Post-Order Traversal:
	- visits current node after child nodes
	- root always last node visited
